- <b>1-</b> We are going to ask the user for the number of integers to be entered by keyboard. For each of these numbers, 
we are going to create a tuple where the first entry is the integer and the second entry is the word "positive", "negative" or "zero" 
depending on the sign of the integer. We will save all the tuples in a list and display them.

- <b>2-</b> We are going to ask the user for integers from 1 to 10 until he enters 0. For each of these numbers, we are going to create a 
tuple where the first entry is the integer number and the second entry is the word "fail", "pass", "good" or "excellent" depending 
on the interval to which the integer number belongs. We will display the newly created tuple to the user.
The different categories are:

fail if the grade belongs to [1, 5) pass if the grade belongs to [5, 7) outstanding if the grade belongs to [7, 9) excellent if the grade belongs to [9, 10].

- <b>3-</b> Given a sentence entered by the user, let's create a list with 3 tuples of 2 entries. The first tuple will contain the number of vowels; 
the second, the number of consonants; and the last, the number of blanks. For each tuple, the first entry will be an explanatory string 
and the second entry will be the corresponding value.

- <b>4-</b> We will ask the user for a subject ("Math", "Language", "History", "Computer Science" or "Music") and the grade in that subject 
until a different subject is entered. The user can repeat a subject as many times as he/she wants. The grade will have to be from 1 to 10. 
We will store the information (subject, grade) in a tuple. The tuples will be stored in a list. Finally, for each subject, we will show the average grade.

- <b>5-</b> We are going to ask the user for the number of points in a plane that he wants to enter. For each point, we will ask for the "x" and "y" coordinates. 
We will store the coordinates (x, y) in tuples of size 3, where the last entry corresponds to the quadrant to which the point belongs. 
All tuples of size 3 will be stored in a list. Finally, we will display all size 3 tuples created, with the format "The point ({x}, {y}) belongs to the quadrant {quadrant}".
